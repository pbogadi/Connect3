# Tic tac toe
TicTacToe is a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does

This is a very, very simple Android game I made in which you can play tic-tac-toe against an opponent.

It was build just to experiment with making an Android app, learning the SDK etc.
